      [ Block elements and inline elements ]
      This shows us a couple of very important behaviors associated with block and inline boxes:
        Block boxes always appear below the previous block element. This is the “natural” or “static” flow of an HTML document when it gets rendered by a web browser.
        The width of block boxes is set automatically based on the width of its parent container. In this case, our blocks are always the width of the browser window.
        The default height of block boxes is based on the content it contains. When you narrow the browser window, the <h1> gets split over two lines, and its height adjusts accordingly.
        Inline boxes don’t affect vertical spacing. They’re not for determining layout—they’re for styling stuff inside of a block.
        The width of inline boxes is based on the content it contains, not the width of the parent element.      

      [ Changing box behavior ]
       This comes in handy when you’re trying to turn <a> elements into buttons or format <img/> elements (both of these are inline boxes by default).        
    -->
    <h1>Headings Are Block Elements</h1>

    <p>Paragraphs are blocks, too. <em>However</em>, &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;
       elements are not. They are <strong>inline</strong> elements.</p>

    <!-- 
      [ Vertical margin collapse ]
      Add block level element(invisible element between them) or else it would not properly be displayed as you set.
      Only consecutive elements can collapse into each other. 

      A third option to avoid margin collapse is to stick to a bottom-only or top-only margin convention. For instance, if all your elements only define a bottom margin, there’s no potential for them to collapse.
    <div style='padding-top: 1px'></div>  Add this 
    -->

    <p>Block elements define the flow of the HTML document, while inline elements
       do not.</p>

    <!-- 
      [ Generic boxes ]
      Both <div> and <span> are “container” elements that don’t have any affect on the semantic structure of an HTML document. They do, however, provide a hook for adding CSS styles to arbitrary sections of a web page.
      The only real difference between a <div> and a <span> is that the former is for block-level content while the latter is meant for inline content.
    -->
    <div>Button</div>

    <!-- 
      [ Aligning boxes ]
      We already saw the text-align property, which aligns the content and inline boxes inside of a block-level element. Aligning block boxes is another story.
    -->

    <!-- 
      [ Centering with auto-margins ]
      When you set the left and right margin of a block-level element to auto, it will center the block in its parent element.

      margin: 20px auto;
      
      Note that this only works on blocks that have an explicit width defined on them. Remove that width: 200px line, and our button will be the full width of the browser, making “center alignment” meaningless.
